— You need to provide the path to the driver binary (e.g., `chromedriver.exe`, `geckodriver.exe`) using code like this in your Selenium script:

```java
System.setProperty(“webdriver.chrome.driver”, “path/to/chromedriver”);
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
```

3. **Use WebDriverManager (Optional)**: Alternatively, you can simplify managing browser drivers by using **WebDriverManager**. This tool automatically downloads the correct version of the driver.

Example using WebDriverManager:

```java
import io.github.bonigarcia.wdm.WebDriverManager;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Automatically set up ChromeDriver using WebDriverManager
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

// Navigate to a webpage
driver.get(“https://www.google.com");

// Close the browser
driver.quit();
}
}
```

### Summary of Browser Drivers:
- **ChromeDriver**: For automating Google Chrome.
- **GeckoDriver**: For automating Mozilla Firefox.
- **EdgeDriver**: For automating Microsoft Edge (both legacy and Chromium-based versions).
- **SafariDriver**: For automating Safari on macOS.
- **InternetExplorerDriver**: For automating Internet Explorer.
- **OperaDriver**: For automating the Opera browser.

Each driver allows Selenium WebDriver to interact with the respective browser, providing a seamless way to automate browser actions and test web applications across different environments.

5.What are the steps to create simple WebDriver script? Explain with code.

To create a simple WebDriver script using Selenium, you’ll need to follow a few key steps. Here is a guide on how to set up and write a basic script that launches a browser, navigates to a website, performs some actions, and then closes the browser.

### **Steps to Create a Simple WebDriver Script**

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
— Install **Java Development Kit (JDK)**.
— Set up **Selenium WebDriver** and dependencies using a build tool like Maven or manually adding JARs.
— Optionally, use **WebDriverManager** to simplify browser driver management.

2. **Install WebDriverManager Dependency (Optional but Recommended)**:
If using Maven, add this to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
<artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
<version>4.11.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
<artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
<version>5.5.3</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

3. **Create a Basic Selenium WebDriver Script**:
— Import Selenium packages.
— Set up the WebDriver.
— Open the browser and navigate to a webpage.
— Perform actions (like searching or clicking).
— Close the browser after the actions are complete.

### **Sample Code**

Here is a simple Selenium WebDriver script that opens a browser, navigates to Google, searches for “Selenium WebDriver,” and then closes the browser:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
import io.github.bonigarcia.wdm.WebDriverManager;

public class SimpleWebDriverScript {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Step 1: Setup WebDriver for Chrome using WebDriverManager
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();

// Step 2: Create a new instance of the ChromeDriver
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

try {
// Step 3: Navigate to Google homepage
driver.get(“https://www.google.com");

// Step 4: Find the search box element using its name attribute
WebElement searchBox = driver.findElement(By.name(“q”));

// Step 5: Type the search term “Selenium WebDriver” into the search box
searchBox.sendKeys(“Selenium WebDriver”);

// Step 6: Submit the search form
searchBox.submit();

// Step 7: Wait for the results page to load and display the results
Thread.sleep(3000);

// Step 8: Print the title of the page to the console
System.out.println(“Page title is: “ + driver.getTitle());

} catch (InterruptedException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
// Step 9: Close the browser
driver.quit();
}
}
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **Setting Up WebDriverManager**:
— `WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();`: This line automatically sets up and configures the correct version of the ChromeDriver for your Chrome browser. You won’t need to manually download the driver.

2. **Creating a WebDriver Instance**:
— `WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();`: This line initializes a new Chrome browser session using the ChromeDriver.

3. **Navigating to a Web Page**:
— `driver.get(“https://www.google.com");`: This method tells WebDriver to open the URL in the browser.

4. **Finding an Element**:
— `driver.findElement(By.name(“q”));`: Finds the search input box on the Google homepage using its HTML name attribute (`q`).

5. **Sending Input**:
— `searchBox.sendKeys(“Selenium WebDriver”);`: Enters the search query “Selenium WebDriver” into the search box.

6. **Submitting the Search**:
— `searchBox.submit();`: Submits the form, simulating pressing the “Enter” key after typing the search term.

7. **Waiting for Results**:
— `Thread.sleep(3000);`: Pauses the execution for 3 seconds to allow the search results page to load. This is a simple wait mechanism, but in more complex scripts, you might use **explicit waits** for better control.

8. **Printing the Page Title**:
— `System.out.println(“Page title is: “ + driver.getTitle());`: Prints the title of the search results page to the console, which should include “Selenium WebDriver” as part of the title.

9. **Closing the Browser**:
— `driver.quit();`: Closes the browser window and ends the WebDriver session, freeing up resources.

### **Conclusion**:
This basic script demonstrates how to:
1. Set up WebDriver for a specific browser (Chrome).
2. Navigate to a web page (Google).
3. Interact with web elements (search box).
4. Automate simple browser actions (searching for a term).
5. Handle browser sessions by quitting after test execution.

### **Additional Tips**:
- **Handling Dynamic Elements**: Use WebDriver’s explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait`) to wait for elements that might take time to load dynamically.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: You can easily switch to another browser by using the respective browser driver (e.g., `FirefoxDriver`, `EdgeDriver`).
- **Advanced Operations**: You can extend this script to click buttons, navigate through multiple pages, extract text from web elements, and more.

This is a basic but fully functional script that can serve as a foundation for more advanced Selenium testing scenarios.
